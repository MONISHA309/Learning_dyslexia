# Early Detection and Support for Learning Disabilities: A Machine Learning Approach Empowering Educators

  This project aims to develop a machine learning-based system that can analyze educational data to detect early signs of learning disabilities. By providing educators with actionable insights, the project hopes to facilitate timely interventions and tailored support for students, ultimately promoting better educational outcomes.

## Dependencies
  1. pandas
  2. numpy 
  3. scikit-learn 
  4. matplotlib and seaborn
     
## Building and Training of Model
  1. Data Cleaning & Preprocessing: Handling missing data, converting categorical variables to numeric values, and selecting relevant features for training.
  2. Data Visualization: Understanding the distribution of key features like gender, native language, and age, and exploring the relationship between these features and dyslexia.
  3. Model Training: Multiple machine learning models such as Random Forest, Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, and SVM are trained to predict dyslexia.
  4. Evaluation: Accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, and confusion matrix are used to evaluate the model's performance.

## Result 
  Logistic regression model provides the highest accuracy as 89.8%.
